# Scenario 2 Coaching + Result Feedback QA Fix Report

**Task:** TASK-0126 / CHAT-ENGINE-001
**Reviewed QA:** TASK-0125
**Owner:** Engine / Godot
**Date:** 2026-05-28
**Status:** Passed
**Scope:** Local-only Godot prototype QA follow-up. No export, deploy, public route, registry, production config, FTP, Captain Ether, Nav Desk, auth, VTS expansion, Region B, or final maritime training claim work.

## Source Documents Reviewed

- `game.brkovic.ltd/docs/watch-officer/scenario-two-coaching-result-feedback-ux-spec.md`
- `game.brkovic.ltd/docs/watch-officer/scenario-two-coaching-result-feedback-implementation-report.md`

## Fixes Implemented

- Added the required Scenario 2 ready-briefing line:
  - `Region A / VTS inactive`
- Added isolated early-starboard live coaching when Engine-exported state confirms early starboard action and no stronger cue is active:
  - Primary cue: `Early starboard alteration made.`
  - Chips: `Starboard early`, `Draft training`

The change remains display-only over runtime snapshot state. The HUD binder still does not compute encounter class, CPA/TCPA, warning severity, pass state, or maritime correctness.

## Test Strengthening

Updated `test_scenario_two_coaching_result_feedback_pack.gd` to assert:

- Scenario 2 ready briefing includes `Region A / VTS inactive`.
- Isolated early-starboard running state shows `Early starboard alteration made.`.
- Early-starboard chips are capped to `Starboard early` and `Draft training`.

## Validation

Focused and affected local headless tests run with `godot4 --headless`:

scenario_two_hud_binding_readability_pack_test: 29 passed, 0 failed

```

## Scope Preserved

- Scenario 1 default selection, briefing, decision coaching, result feedback, and local reset behavior remain covered by passing tests.
- Scenario 2 remains local-only through the existing prototype selector/playable flow.
- No `public/`, export artifacts, deploy files, hub route, registry, Captain Ether, Nav Desk, auth, production config, FTP, VTS expansion, Region B, or final maritime training claims were touched.
- No files outside the assigned write set were edited.

## Next Expected

QA rerun.
