**Task:** TASK-0124 / CHAT-ENGINE-001
**Owner:** Engine / Godot
**Date:** 2026-05-28
**Status:** Passed
**Scope:** Local-only Godot prototype implementation. No export, deploy, public route, registry, production config, FTP, Captain Ether, Nav Desk, VTS expansion, Region B, or final maritime training claim work.

## Summary

The existing Godot prototype already covered the core Scenario 2 briefing, opening coaching, qualitative CPA coaching, port-to-port success cue, result status binding, and result feedback for positive completion.

One narrow local refinement was added in `hud_snapshot_binder.gd`: Scenario 2 now prioritizes Engine-exported late-action and port-alteration-risk states ahead of CPA caution, port-to-port success, and monitoring cues, while CPA danger/immediate and terminal results still outrank them. Scenario 2 `result_reasons` now uses the same Scenario 2-specific reason builder as the visible result feedback.

## Implemented

- Added Scenario 2 warning labels/reasons for late head-on action and risk-increasing port alteration keys.
- Added display-only Scenario 2 helpers that read already-exported `runtime_snapshot["scenario_two"]` and warning keys without computing geometry, CPA/TCPA, encounter class, pass relationship, or result state.
- Added Scenario 2 live coaching priority coverage for:
  - `Port alteration increased risk in this scenario.`
  - `Late alteration. Act now.`
  - CPA danger outranking port alteration risk.
  - CPA caution outranking port-to-port achieved.
  - terminal result states outranking live coaching.
- Aligned exported HUD `result_reasons` with Scenario 2-specific result feedback reasons.
- Added focused headless test:
  - `game.brkovic.ltd/prototypes/watch-officer-godot/tests/runtime/test_scenario_two_coaching_result_feedback_pack.gd`

## Validation

Focused tests run with `godot4 --headless`:

```text
scenario_two_coaching_result_feedback_pack_test: 62 passed, 0 failed
scenario_two_hud_binding_readability_pack_test: 29 passed, 0 failed
scenario_one_decision_coaching_pack_test: 78 passed, 0 failed

scenario_two_playable_scene_slice_test: 57 passed, 0 failed

```

## Scope Preserved

- Scenario 1 default playable path, briefing, coaching, result feedback, VTS-inactive behavior, and local reset behavior remain covered by passing tests.
- Scenario 2 remains selectable locally only through the existing prototype flow.
- HUD binding still does not import or call simulation modules, Scenario 2 classifier, Scenario 2 pass detector, CPA/TCPA solver, warning pipeline, safe-water monitor, or result evaluator.
- Player-facing Scenario 2 briefing/coaching/result feedback still excludes `scenario_two_debug`, numeric CPA/TCPA, raw geometry, thresholds, replay seed/tolerance, legal rule claims, official/certified claims, public route/deploy language, and final maritime training claims.
- No files outside the assigned write set were edited.

## Next Expected

QA review.
