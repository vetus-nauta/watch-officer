# Local Web Export Scenario 2 Coaching + Result Feedback Report

**Task:** TASK-0128 / CHAT-ENGINE-001
**Owner:** Engine / Godot
**Date:** 2026-05-28
**Status:** passed

## Summary

Created a prototype-local Godot Web export for the QA-approved Scenario 2 Coaching + Result Feedback Pack using the existing `Web Local` export preset.

Artifacts remain only under:

```text
game.brkovic.ltd/prototypes/watch-officer-godot/exports/web-local/
```

No files were copied to `public/`, no staged public candidate was updated, and no deploy, FTP, hub route, registry, Captain Ether, Nav Desk, auth, production config, VTS expansion, Region B, or final maritime training claim work was performed.

## Pre-Export Tests

Focused and affected local headless tests were run with `godot4 --headless`:

```text
scenario_two_coaching_result_feedback_pack_test: 65 passed, 0 failed
scenario_two_hud_binding_readability_pack_test: 29 passed, 0 failed
scenario_two_playable_scene_slice_test: 57 passed, 0 failed
scenario_selector_local_flow_test: 51 passed, 0 failed
scenario_one_decision_coaching_pack_test: 78 passed, 0 failed
briefing_result_feedback_pack_test: 56 passed, 0 failed
hud_binding_readability_pack_test: 43 passed, 0 failed
local_play_loop_polish_pack_test: 45 passed, 0 failed
```

## Export Command

```text
godot4 --headless --path game.brkovic.ltd/prototypes/watch-officer-godot --export-release "Web Local" exports/web-local/index.html
```

The export command completed with exit code `0`.

Non-blocking Godot warnings observed:

```text
Custom cursor shape not supported by this display server.
Blend file import is enabled in project settings, but no Blender path is configured in editor settings.
```

## Export Verification

Expected Web export runtime files are present:

```text
index.html
index.js
index.wasm
index.pck
index.worker.js
index.audio.worklet.js
```

Generated local artifact list:

```text
index.apple-touch-icon.png
index.apple-touch-icon.png.import
index.audio.worklet.js
index.html
index.icon.png
index.icon.png.import
index.js
index.pck
index.png
index.png.import
index.wasm
index.worker.js
```

The generated `index.html` references `index.js`, `index.pck`, and `index.wasm` with the exported file sizes.

## Scope Preserved

- Source gameplay code was not edited for this task.
- Export artifacts remain prototype-local under `game.brkovic.ltd/prototypes/watch-officer-godot/exports/web-local/`.
- `public/` was not edited or used as a copy target.
- No staged public candidate was updated.
- No deploy or FTP action was performed.
- Hub route, registry, Captain Ether, Nav Desk, auth, and production config were not touched.
- No VTS expansion or Region B work was performed.
- No official, certified, legal, COLREGS-compliant, or final maritime training claim was added.

## Next Expected

QA local Web export smoke for Scenario 2 Coaching + Result Feedback.
