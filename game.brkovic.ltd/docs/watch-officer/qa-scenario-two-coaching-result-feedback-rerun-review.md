# QA Scenario 2 Coaching + Result Feedback Rerun Review

**Task:** TASK-0127
**Reviewed Task:** TASK-0126
**Original QA:** TASK-0125
**Owner:** CHAT-QA-001 / Maritime QA
**Date:** 2026-05-28
**Status:** approved

## Result

TASK-0126 fixes are approved for the local Scenario 2 Coaching + Result Feedback Pack.

The two TASK-0125 QA findings are resolved:

- Scenario 2 ready briefing includes `Region A / VTS inactive`.
- Isolated early-starboard live coaching shows `Early starboard alteration made.` with `Starboard early` and `Draft training` chips.

This approval is local Godot prototype QA only. It does not approve export, browser release, deploy, public route, registry entry, production integration, VTS expansion, Region B, or final maritime training claims.

## Fix Verification

- `hud_snapshot_binder.gd` Scenario 2 briefing now includes the exact required line `Region A / VTS inactive`.
- `test_scenario_two_coaching_result_feedback_pack.gd` asserts the Scenario 2 briefing Region/VTS line.
- `hud_snapshot_binder.gd` now maps isolated Engine-exported early-starboard confirmation to `Early starboard alteration made.`.
- `test_scenario_two_coaching_result_feedback_pack.gd` asserts the isolated early-starboard cue and approved chips: `Starboard early`, `Draft training`.
- The focused test confirms the HUD binder still does not import simulation modules, compute Scenario 2 classifier/pass event, compute CPA/TCPA, or read Scenario 2 QA debug.

```

## Scope Checks

- Scenario 1 default selection, briefing, decision coaching, result feedback, and local reset regressions remain passing.
- Scenario 2 remains local-only through the existing prototype selector/playable flow.
- VTS remains disabled/inactive in affected coverage.
- Region B remains absent from the reviewed implementation path.
- Player-facing tested surfaces continue to exclude debug values, numeric CPA/TCPA debug fields, official/certified/legal/COLREGS-compliant claims, and final maritime training claims.
- Scoped worktree review found no `public/`, export artifact, deploy, hub route, or registry file change for this QA rerun.

## Browser And Export

Not run. This rerun is local Godot headless QA only.

QA did not run Godot Web export, local browser smoke, production browser smoke, screenshot approval, artifact checks, MIME/header checks, FTP, deploy, hub route, or registry validation.

## Scope Preserved

QA created only:

```text
game.brkovic.ltd/docs/watch-officer/qa-scenario-two-coaching-result-feedback-rerun-review.md
```

QA did not edit code, Godot scenes/scripts/tests, public files, export artifacts, production deploy, hub route, registry, Captain Ether, Nav Desk, auth, production config, FTP, VTS expansion, Region B, or final maritime training claims.

## Next Expected

Game Director sprint closeout.
