## Task

Implement or confirm the local-only Scenario 2 Coaching + Result Feedback Pack in the Godot prototype.

If current implementation already satisfies the sprint intent, strengthen focused coverage and report that no production/export work was needed. If a small local-only refinement is needed, implement it narrowly.
