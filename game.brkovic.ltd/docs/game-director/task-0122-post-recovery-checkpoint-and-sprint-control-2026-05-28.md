# TASK-0122 - Post-Recovery Checkpoint And Sprint Control

**Chat ID:** CHAT-GD-001
**Department:** Game Director / ШЕФ ПРОЕКТА Watch Officer
**Assigned by:** ШЕФ ПРОЕКТА Watch Officer
**Date:** 2026-05-28
**Status:** Completed

## Working Directory

```

## Task

Stabilize the post-crash project state, confirm the current source-of-truth position, and open the next controlled sprint.

## Sprint Focus

```text
Scenario 2 Coaching + Result Feedback Pack
```

This sprint improves Scenario 2 player understanding inside the existing local/public prototype flow. It does not create a new scenario, new route, VTS mode, Region B support, certification wording, or production deploy approval.

## Current Checkpoint

- Watch Officer mirror repository: `git@github.com:vetus-nauta/watch-officer.git`
- Mirror branch state: `main...origin/main` is synchronized at checkpoint start.
- Canonical project path exists: `/home/alexey/GitHub/Revoyacht/brkovic-ltd`
- Watch Officer allowed areas were aligned from mirror to canonical on 2026-05-28.
- Current public prototype status: Scenario 1 / Scenario 2 selector build live after `TASK-0121`.

## Recovery Notes

Allowed Watch Officer areas aligned into canonical:

- `game.brkovic.ltd/docs/game-director/`
- `game.brkovic.ltd/docs/watch-officer/`
- `game.brkovic.ltd/docs/roles/`
- `game.brkovic.ltd/prototypes/watch-officer-godot/` source, tests, and scenario data, excluding `.godot/` and `exports/`
- `game.brkovic.ltd/public/play/watch-officer/`

Preserved exclusions:

- Captain Ether implementation;
- Nav Desk;
- auth;
- private config and secrets;
- unrelated production config;
- unrelated `brkovic-ltd` site files;
- generated Godot `.godot/`;
- prototype export cache;
- WebStorm/Vite scaffold unless explicitly approved.

## Verification Already Run

Focused canonical Godot checks after alignment:

```text
scenario_selector_local_flow_test: 51 passed, 0 failed
scenario_two_playable_scene_slice_test: 57 passed, 0 failed
scenario_two_runtime_state_export_orchestrator_test: 27 passed, 0 failed
scenario_loader_test: 121 passed, 0 failed
```

## Sprint Assignments

- `TASK-0123`: UX spec for Scenario 2 Coaching + Result Feedback Pack.
- `TASK-0124`: Engine local implementation and focused test.
- `TASK-0125`: QA local review after Engine report.

## Boundaries

- No production deploy.
- No FTP.
- No public route or registry change.
- No Captain Ether implementation changes.
- No Nav Desk changes.
- No auth changes.
- No VTS expansion.
- No Region B support.
- No final, certified, official, legal, or COLREGS-compliant training claims.

## Required Closeout

Close this task only after:

- UX spec exists or is explicitly blocked;
- Engine implementation report exists or is explicitly blocked;
- QA review plan or review report exists;
- focused tests are run where implementation changes occur;
- mirror/canonical sync state is reported.

## Closeout

`TASK-0123` created the Scenario 2 Coaching + Result Feedback UX spec and was accepted for Engine implementation.

`TASK-0124` implemented the local Godot Scenario 2 Coaching + Result Feedback Pack and created focused test coverage.

`TASK-0125` returned `changes-required` with two narrow findings:

- Scenario 2 briefing required `Region A / VTS inactive`.
- Isolated early-starboard running state required `Early starboard alteration made.`.

`TASK-0126` fixed both findings.

`TASK-0127` approved the fixes for local Godot prototype scope.

Final sprint status:

```text
Scenario 2 Coaching + Result Feedback Pack: local QA approved.
Export/deploy: not approved by this sprint.
```
